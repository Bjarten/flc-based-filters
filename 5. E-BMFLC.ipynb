    "The Enhanced Band-limited Multiple Fourier Linear Combiner  (E-BMFLC) filter is an improvement on the BMWFLC. The E-BMFLC filter was introduced in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7407298), and a new dynamic estimation strategy for the E-BMFLC in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8308681), but we will not review the latter one at this time.  \n",

The main goal of the BMFLC was to estimate the involuntary motion $m_{k-i}$  in real-time. The E-BMFLC have been developed to address two two major drawbacks of the BMFLC filter, inaccurate error calculation and infinite memory.  The implementation of the E-BMFLC filter is divided into two phases of enhancement; $\\textit{Phase}$ 1) $\\textit{Harmonic Model Enrichment:}$ To deal with the incorrect error calculation, and $\\textit{Phase}$ 2) $\\textit{Memory manipulation}$: Using a windowed memory instead of the conventional infinite memory. \n",

To do this different band-limited windows of frequency can be considered to extract various frequency ranges. Using this technuiqe, the signal modeling and frequency truncation are decoupled, while in the formulation of BMFLC filter these two steps are fused. Two frequency ranges will be considered, $\\left[\\omega_{a},\\omega_{b} \\right]$ and $\\left[\\omega_{c},\\omega_{d} \\right]$, for voluntary and involuntary motion respectively. In order to extract $\\hat{m}_{k-i}$ and $\\hat{m}_{k-v}$, the calculated $\\textbf{w}_k$ and $\\textbf{x}_k$ should be truncated considering the frequency range of the voluntary and involuntary motion.
