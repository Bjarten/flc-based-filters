    "Any arbitrary periodic function can be expressed as an infinite sum of  weighted sinusoids, this is called a *Fourier series*. The Fourier series can be expressed in three different forms, *exponential*, *amplitude-phase* and *trigonometric*, we will only use the latter.  The trigonometric Fourier series of a periodic function $f(t)$ is given by \n",

The frequencies of the harmonics are strictly integer multiples of the fundamental frequency: $f_0,\\,2f_0,\\,3f_0,\\, \\ldots \\,nf_0$. \n",

    "The distinction between amplitude and magnitude can be somewhat confusing, and often these two terms are used interchangeably. Lets try to make the destination as clear as possible how these will be used when we talk about Fourier series. The Fourier components $a_n$ and $b_n$ are the amplitudes of the cosinusoids and sinusoids, respectively, they can have both positive and negative values. When we take the RSS of these two we get the magnitude, which is always positive. The amplitude and magnitude can have the same value in some [cases](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/books/the-intuitive-guide-to-fourier-analysis-and-spectral-estimation-with-matlab-langton.html).\n",

For this Fourier series, the amplitudes $b_n$ of the sinusoids will be the same as the  magnitude $M_n$, since all the values of $b_n$ are positive.
